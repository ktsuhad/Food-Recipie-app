# Food Recipe App

This is a food recipe app developed using React with ViteJS. It allows users to search and discover various recipes and provides detailed information about each recipe.

## Environment Configuration

To run the app properly, you need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```
VITE_APP_ID=<Your App ID>
VITE_APP_KEY=<Your App Key>
```

These variables are required for accessing certain features and services within the app.

### Setting up the environment variables

1. Create a file named `.env` at the root of your project.
2. Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

```
VITE_APP_ID=<Your App ID>
VITE_APP_KEY=<Your App Key>
```

3. Replace `<Your App ID>` and `<Your App Key>` with the appropriate values. These values can be obtained by signing up for the respective services/APIs used in your app.

### API Keys

The `VITE_APP_ID` and `VITE_APP_KEY` environment variables are used to authenticate and access the APIs required by the app. Make sure to obtain valid API keys from the respective services and replace the placeholders in the `.env` file.

**Note**: It's important to keep your API keys secure and avoid committing them to version control systems like Git. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
